    <ul>
      <li>
        Directed a 4-person Data Science team to deliver GenAI solutions for audit pipelines, integrating LLMs,
        HuggingFace Transformers, LangGraph agents, and vector-database RAG retrieval for document verification and
        phone-sales anomaly detection. Built and tested optimized deployments on Linux, enabling ~$250K in cost avoidance.
      </li>
      <li>
        Developed computer vision solution with YOLO and OpenCV to automate weekly and monthly compliance monitoring in
        320+ bank branches, replacing manual audits on limited samples. Enabled full-year, full-population coverage,
        reducing 40,000+ audit hours and avoiding ~$1M in annual costs.
